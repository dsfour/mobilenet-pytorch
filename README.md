# PyTorch implementation of MobileNet-v1 and MobileNet-v2

This repository contains simple, not generalized, implementations of two versions of MobileNet. 

These implementations are not generalized, meaning they only strictly follow model architectures presented in two MobileNet papers. To modify model architectures, you must directly change model implementation in models directory.
