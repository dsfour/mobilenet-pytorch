# PyTorch implementation of MobileNet-v1 and MobileNet-v2

This is quick, and thus not generalized, implementation of two versions of MobileNet. 

This implementation is not generalized, meaning it only strictly follows model architecture presented in MobileNet paper. To modify model architecture, you must directly change model implementation.
